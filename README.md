# Slim Vim

A simple `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf` file

Using vim and tmux together is a surprisingly good development setup that can be done all on a terminal.
Useful for when you need to do a bit of devving on a server but don't want to faff around with vundle

## Tips

Asides from the basic vim shortcuts and modes, there are some other nifty features that come out the box

### Shell Commands

You can execute shell commands with `:!`

For example `:!pwd`

### Splits

If you're not familiar with vim splits, you can split a window in half with either `:vsp` or `:sp`

You can cycle through splits by double-tapping `Ctrl-W`

### File explorer

If you try to `:e` a directory, vim will instead open a file explorer.

You can open one in your root directory with `:e .`
